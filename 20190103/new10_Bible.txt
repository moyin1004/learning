genesis 1

1 	in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2	and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3 	and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day  
6 	and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters
